* Use of inheritance for the purpose of reuse hasn't turned out so well when it comes to maintenance
* The one constant thing in software development is "CHANGE"
* "HAS-A" can be better than IS-A
* Power of **Loose Coupling**
    * When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but have very little knowledge about each other. This is very essential in developing a flexible software
    * Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects
* Adding behaviour at run time
    * Our goal is to allow classes to be easily extended to incorporate new behaviour without modifying the existing code
    * We need designs that are resilient to change and flexible enough to take on new functionality to meet changing requirements
    * Applying OPEN-CLOSED principle **everywhere** is wasteful,unnecessary,and can lead to complex,hard to understand code.
