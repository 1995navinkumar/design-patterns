## Strategy Pattern
```The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms,encapsulates each code, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from the client that use it.```

## Observer Pattern
```The Observer Pattern defines a one to many dependency between objects so that when one objects changes state, all of its dependent are notified and updated automatically```

* Just like a newspaper or magazine subscription
* Publishers + Subscribers = Observer Patters
* Observer Pattern provides an object design such that the subject and observers are loosely coupled

## Decorator Pattern
```The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extended functionality```

## Factory Method Pattern
```The Factory Method Pattern defines an interface for creating an object,but lets subclass decide which class to instantiate.Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.```
